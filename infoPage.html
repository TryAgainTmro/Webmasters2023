                    <h2>FOSSIL FUELS: The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Fossil Fuels make up 79% of the US energy uses with 33% of that being natural gas and 36% being petroleum.</p>
                    <p>Petroleum is mostly used for transportation (like the gas you fill up in your car) with the US consuming 20.4% of all petroleum in the world</p>
                    <p>Natural gas is largely used for home appliances such as thermostats, gas ovens, and gas stonves</p>
                    <p>Oil likely will run out by 2060, and if it won't run out, it will become extremely expensive. Gasoline has also been getting more and more expensive nearly doubling in price from 2020 to 2022</p>

                    <h2>Natural Gas Replacements/Minimization</h2>
                    <p>Replacing natural gas stoves and ovens for electrical ones are one way to lower natural gas emissions. According to the irs, biomass stoves and boilers offer tax rebates of 2000 dollars.</p>
                    <p>Driving less is the most efficient way to minimize gasoline. Public transportation and other methods of movement (such as biking) are good alternatives to driving. Its important to research buses in your city and consider walking or biking instead of driving short distances. Before switching to a newer or greener model, its important to let your current car live out its lifespan. In general, it is best to keep using a car until it must be switched instead of scrapping a working car for a newer green model. When purchasing a new car, choosing an electric car is better for the environment than a hybrid or a pure gas car. The IRS have stated that the tax rebate for new electric cars is 7500 dollars. The price is also decreasing plus you can help the environment.</p>

                    <h2>Alternatives for Air Conditioning/Heating</h2>
                    <p>Cooling is a big contributor to global warming. Many of them use HFC, which is a very potent greenhouse gas. Air conditioning uses a lot of energy. Space cooling uses 20% of all electricity used in buildings and is the fastest growing use of energy in buildings globally. Consider replacing your current home cooler with a geothermal or air source pump.</p>
                    <p>Geothermal heat pumps use heat and air from underground to steadily heat and cool your home. Though they are more expensive than air source heat pumps, they can prove to be cheaper over time. Its important to induct a home audit before finalizing a purchase og a geothermal pump to insure your area has access to heat wells.</p>
                    <p>Air source heat pumps take heat from the air and alters it to disperse throughout the home to cool or heat. The tax rebate for either of these types of pumps is 30% and the maximum amount of rebate you can earn from home improvements is 3200$</p>

                    <h2>Home Audits</h2>
                    <p>Professional Home Assessments (PHA) are when a government or local professional inspect your home for energy usage, gas leaks, and overall green and cleanliness. Audits can help make distinctions between which kinds of heat pumps fit best for your house, which appliances to purchase for your home, and where to make large additions, like windows, doors, and solar panels. You can make up to 150 dollars in tax rebates for professional audits, and remember: the total tax rebate you can make from home improvements is 3200 dollars. </p>
